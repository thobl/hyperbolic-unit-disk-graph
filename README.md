# Hyperbolic Unit Disk Graph #

An interactive visualization of hyperbolic unit disk graphs.  The main
goal is to illustrate how the graph structure depends on the threshold
distance relative to the size of the ground space.

## Building ##

The repository already contains a build, available via the above link.
So you don't need to build it yourself, unless you want to make
changes to the code.  In this case, you can build it (assuming you
have [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) installed) by running
`./build-site.sh`.  This will output `elm.min.js`, which is loaded by
`index.html`.
